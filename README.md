### Setup Configuration

Used to setup my personal linux machines with my ideal coding and DevOps software.

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lprior-repo/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bare-metal.sh | bash`

Insert password. 

Watch it work without ever failing like all software of all time always. 

Be great today! 

Could I find better ways to automate this more? Yes, considering I really shouldn't have to run this more than once a year or I really screwed something up it's enough good for mu uses. If you have more uses for it please go nuts and hopefully it will be of some help to you!
